# Changelog

All notable changes to Engram are documented here.

This project follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) and uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/) to auto-generate GitHub Release notes from commit history on each tag push.

## Where to Find Release Notes

Full release notes with changelogs per version live on the **[GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/yersonargotev/engram/releases)**.

GoReleaser generates them automatically from commits, filtering by type:

- `feat:` / `fix:` / `refactor:` / `chore:` commits appear in the release notes
- `docs:` / `test:` / `ci:` commits are excluded from the generated changelog

## Breaking Changes

Breaking changes are always marked with a `type:breaking-change` label and documented in the release notes with a migration path. The `fix!:` and `feat!:` commit format triggers a major version bump.

## Unreleased

<!-- Changes that are merged but not yet released are tracked here until the next tag. -->

### Engram v3.0.0 breaking boundary

- **breaking:** remove the complete Admission experiment in Engram v3.0.0 with
  no deprecation window and no compatibility layer. The independent
  `saved | skipped | needs_review` checkpoint contract remains; a
  `needs_review` proposal is immutable local audit evidence, and opening a v3
  database transactionally removes the retired experimental tables and data.
  [ADR-0008](docs/adr/0008-retire-the-admission-experiment.md) is the normative
  decision. Superseded ADRs and research under `docs/research/` remain
  historical evidence rather than active product guidance.

### Memory checkpoints

- **fix(setup):** rewrite the installed Cursor plugin MCP command to the copied binary's absolute path. Cursor resolves `./bin/engram` against the workspace cwd, so a leftover relative command fails with `spawn <workspace>/bin/engram ENOENT` even when `~/.cursor/plugins/local/engram/bin/engram` exists.
- **feat(setup):** make `engram setup` the Memory install control plane. Status reports leftover Packy `engram-memory-cli` copies as non-canonical, a disabled standalone CLI skill is not Codex activation, and docs tell existing Packy users to migrate through setup while keeping Managed Pack compatibility.
- **feat(setup):** add the editorial `engram-memory` skill in the repository skill tree and hash-lock Claude and Codex plugin projections to that file.
- **feat(memory):** add a local-only, idempotent checkpoint ledger plus equivalent CLI and MCP record/status surfaces for semantic `skipped` outcomes; checkpoint data is excluded from Memory search, context, counts, export, sync, cloud materialization, and Obsidian export.
- **feat(memory):** complete the `saved` disposition with same-project Memory references, attachment of existing Memories, atomic inline Memory creation, replay without duplicates, and equivalent CLI/MCP contracts.
- **feat(memory):** complete the `needs_review` disposition with one same-project local Memory proposal, atomic inline creation, replay-safe references, CLI/MCP parity, and no automatic Admission or Promotion.
- **feat(codex):** activate one canonical checkpoint skill and minimal model-visible `SessionStart` cue, forward Codex root-turn identity through `UserPromptSubmit`, and verify the installed activation assets without editing shared instruction files.
- **feat(codex):** enforce terminal root-turn checkpoints on Unix and Windows with one synchronous `Stop` verifier, one identity-preserving recovery continuation, loop prevention, visible integration failures, and exact installed-asset verification.
- **chore(codex):** retire exact-owned legacy instruction and compaction activation through recoverable staging only after the canonical skill, cue, checkpoint CLI/MCP adapters, and Stop verifier are ready; preserve customized or ambiguous state and keep failed upgrades on the prior working path.
- **feat(protocol):** expose Core-owned Protocol contract v1, distribute one parity fixture, declare Managed Pack and Codex plugin support ranges, and gate read-only Codex readiness on the attributable four-axis range intersection. The current and exact prior tuples report `legacy_compatible` because this slice does not change Recall, Capture, MCP-profile, or checkpoint defaults.
- **feat(distribution):** apply the frozen `continue_canary` Recall disposition as a content-addressed, read-only-verifiable outcome that pins the exact evaluated four-axis tuple without release, rollout, legacy contraction, or local-schema participation. A self-contained Git commit/tree membership proof binds the declared source revision to the exact files even in shallow or extracted source, while post-install readiness remains a separate, explicit check.
- **fix(distribution):** preserve the evaluated Recall v1 source artifacts in an immutable in-repository snapshot and verify that snapshot against the frozen SHA-256 and Git object proof, allowing the current Managed Pack to evolve without invalidating historical evidence or CI.
- **feat(skill):** make `checkpoint record` the normal Terminal Memory completion signal, publish the exact `skipped` CLI form, and reserve `checkpoint status` for explicit inspection or ambiguous execution outcomes. Managed Pack 3.3.1 carries the editorial fix while preserving the released 3.3.0 and 3.2.0 compatibility coordinates.

### Memory core

- **fix(store):** establish project ownership forward on legacy sessions instead of rejecting their writes. A database upgraded from the schema where `sessions.project` was nullable still holds sessions that identify no project; those sessions now adopt the project of the write landing on them, in the same transaction and journaled like any other ownership move, so the record and its session agree rather than the write failing permanently. Adoption is refused only when the unowned session already parents a record owned by a different project, which would split that record from its session. Both ownership errors answer `409` with a `code` and a `remedy` naming the exact repair.
- **feat(cli):** add `engram projects rescue-ownership --project <name> [--session <id>] [--observation <id>] [--prompt <id>]`. It performs the same ownership repair as `POST /projects/rescue-ownership` against the local store, so recovery no longer requires `ENGRAM_HTTP_TOKEN` to be configured.
- **fix(store):** resolve the whole rescue plan before mutating anything. The session pass previously claimed dependent parent sessions before any record's ownership was examined, so an unowned session parenting a record owned by another project was moved while the record was left behind — a split in the mirror direction of the case the rescue guards. Sessions and records are now decided together and applied afterwards.
- **fix(server):** report rescue outcomes unambiguously. The response carries `complete` and a `blocked` list naming every item left behind with its reason, and `status` is `partially_rescued` rather than `rescued` when anything was; a partial outcome is no longer indistinguishable from a clean one.
- **fix(store):** read `sessions.project` as nullable in `GetSession`, so a legacy NULL row no longer fails every caller that inspects the session with an opaque scan error.
- **fix(doctor):** read `sessions.project` through `ifnull()` in the diagnostic queries, so `engram doctor` no longer dies with `converting NULL to string is unsupported` on a database upgraded from the schema where the column was nullable. That population is precisely the one the `project_ownership_required` remedy sends to doctor, and it previously got no report at all.
- **fix(store):** read `sessions.project` through `ifnull()` at every remaining site that scanned it raw. An audit of the whole store found the same crash in `RecentSessions` and `AllSessions` (so a single legacy row denied the user `engram context`, `mem_context`, and the TUI session list), in `Export` (the way data leaves the store before a repair), and in `DeleteSession`, `EndSession`, and the `CreateSession` readback (so a legacy session could not be deleted, ended, or re-registered). `sessions.project` is the only column in the schema that is nullable in practice but declared `NOT NULL`: the table is only ever created with `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS`, so the declaration never reaches rows written before it, and no migration rewrites or backfills the column.
- **feat(doctor):** add the `unowned_session_project` check. It reports every session that identifies no project — NULL or blank — and carries the exact `engram projects rescue-ownership --project <name> --session <id>` repair, so the legacy ownership state doctor can now read is also surfaced instead of silently passing. The listing is unscoped by design: an unowned session belongs to no project, so `--project` cannot filter it away.
- **fix(pi):** surface background capture failures on stderr instead of discarding them, so a user whose passive memories stopped being saved gets a signal.
- **fix(store):** reject empty or whitespace-only observation titles consistently on create and update, before any side effect. `engram save` and `mem_save` now refuse a titleless write before opening the store or creating a session, `POST /observations` validates the title before the session lookup so a bad session or project can no longer mask the documented `400`, and `PATCH /observations/{id}` answers `400` rather than `404`. Persisting a titleless observation also enqueues a cloud upsert that the sync validators reject, which blocks every later mutation for the project.

### Cloud sync

- **fix(cloud):** make chunk and mutation push payload limits configurable with `ENGRAM_CLOUD_MAX_PUSH_BYTES` while preserving the 8 MiB default.

### Cloud user token management (`cloud-user-token-management`)

- **feat(cloud):** add principal/human-user/token/project-grant/audit storage foundation (`cloud_principals`, `cloud_human_users`, `cloud_principal_tokens`, `cloud_project_grants`, `cloud_auth_audit_log`) alongside existing sync tables.
- **feat(cloud):** enforce managed-principal project grants for sync chunk/mutation push and pull while preserving legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_ALLOWED_PROJECTS` behavior.
- **feat(cloud):** add managed admin API handlers (`/admin/users`, `/admin/users/{id}/tokens`, `/admin/users/{id}/grants`, and related enable/disable/revoke routes) and dashboard managed-user UX, with audit-backed mutations.
- **feat(cloud):** add dashboard managed-principal sessions and first-admin dashboard bootstrap (`/dashboard/bootstrap`), including audit coverage for admin login and legacy-recovery actions.
- **feat(cloud):** add `engram cloud bootstrap admin --username <name> [--email <email>] [--grant-project <project>]... [--issue-token [name]]` CLI command to create the first managed admin headlessly, with duplicate-bootstrap refusal and `bootstrap.cli` audit events.
- **feat(cloud):** add `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` for dedicated managed-token hashing, distinct from `ENGRAM_JWT_SECRET`.
- **feat(cloud):** wire managed-token authentication into `engram cloud serve` — the runtime principal resolver now checks managed token storage first, then falls back to the legacy `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN`/`ENGRAM_CLOUD_ADMIN` credentials, on every `/sync/*`, `/admin/*`, and dashboard-login request. Requires `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN_PEPPER` to be set; without it, managed-token auth is disabled and the server starts in legacy-only mode exactly as before. See [DOCS.md — Managed users, tokens, and CLI bootstrap](DOCS.md#managed-users-tokens-and-cli-bootstrap).
- **fix(cloud):** dashboard login/bootstrap audit events no longer send the legacy admin/sync principal's synthetic ID (e.g. `legacy:admin`) as `ActorPrincipalID`, which the real Postgres-backed audit table rejects (a non-numeric value against a `BIGINT` foreign key); this previously would have made every legacy admin dashboard login fail with a 500 once an admin identity store was configured.

### Pi package (`pi-engram`)

- **fix(plugin):** allow `mem_session_summary` to accept an explicit `project` fallback when automatic project detection is unavailable.
- **fix(plugin):** fall back to local `.engram/config.json` and surface a clearer version-mismatch diagnostic when the running Engram server lacks `/project/current`.
- **feat(plugin):** add `gentle-engram` package for Pi marketplace installs, with HTTP event capture, Memory Protocol prompt injection, safe `engram mcp` launcher config, and `pi-engram init` setup helper.

### Cloud dashboard visual parity (`cloud-dashboard-visual-parity`)

New and updated routes registered in `internal/cloud/dashboard/dashboard.go`:

- **feat(dashboard):** add `/dashboard/projects/list` HTMX partial with paginated project list and "Paused" badge when sync is disabled
- **feat(dashboard):** add `/dashboard/projects/{name}/observations|sessions|prompts` HTMX partials for project detail tabs
- **feat(dashboard):** add `/dashboard/contributors/list` HTMX partial with paginated contributor list
- **feat(dashboard):** add `/dashboard/contributors/{contributor}` detail page showing recent sessions, observations, and prompts
- **feat(dashboard):** add `/dashboard/admin/users` and `/dashboard/admin/users/list` (admin-gated)
- **feat(dashboard):** add `/dashboard/admin/health` (admin-gated)
- **feat(dashboard):** add `POST /dashboard/admin/projects/{name}/sync` toggle for per-project sync pause (admin-gated; HTTP 409 on paused push)
- **feat(dashboard):** add `/dashboard/sessions/{project}/{sessionID}`, `/dashboard/observations/{project}/{sessionID}/{syncID}`, `/dashboard/prompts/{project}/{sessionID}/{syncID}` composite-ID detail pages
- **fix(dashboard):** removed dead route `/dashboard/admin/contributors`; user/contributor management consolidated under `/dashboard/admin/users`
- **feat(dashboard):** type pills on browser page sourced from `ListDistinctTypes` DB query
- **feat(dashboard):** principal display name bridged via `MountConfig.GetDisplayName`; falls back to `"OPERATOR"` when nil or empty
- **feat(dashboard):** detail page URL scheme uses `{syncID}` (not `{chunkID}`) as the tertiary path segment

### Cloud autosync restoration (`cloud-autosync-restoration`)

Background mutation-based replication for `engram serve` and `engram mcp`:

- **feat(autosync):** `internal/cloud/autosync.Manager` — lease-guarded background push/pull goroutine enabled by `ENGRAM_CLOUD_AUTOSYNC=1` + `ENGRAM_CLOUD_TOKEN` + `ENGRAM_CLOUD_SERVER`
- **feat(cloudserver):** add `POST /sync/mutations/push` (batch up to 100 mutations, configurable body cap defaulting to 8 MiB, per-project auth + pause gate returning HTTP 409 `sync-paused`)
- **feat(cloudserver):** add `GET /sync/mutations/pull?since_seq=N&limit=M` (server-side filtered by enrolled projects; fail-closed when `EnrolledProjectsProvider` not implemented)
- **feat(autosync):** phases: `idle`, `pushing`, `pulling`, `healthy`, `push_failed`, `pull_failed`, `backoff`, `disabled`
- **feat(autosync):** reason codes: `transport_failed`, `auth_required`, `policy_forbidden`, `server_unsupported`, `internal_error`, `sync-paused`
- **feat(autosync):** exponential backoff — base 1s, max 5min, ×2 per failure, ±25% jitter, ceiling at 10 consecutive failures
- **feat(autosync):** `StopForUpgrade` / `ResumeAfterUpgrade` for upgrade-window pause without releasing the sync lease
- **fix(autosync):** SIGTERM cancels context → `releaseLease()` deferred in `Run()` for graceful shutdown

### BREAKING CHANGE: MCP write tools no longer accept a `project` field

The `project` argument has been removed from the JSON schemas of 7 MCP write tools:
`mem_save`, `mem_save_prompt`, `mem_session_start`, `mem_session_end`, `mem_session_summary`, `mem_capture_passive`, `mem_update`.

**Before:** agents could pass `project: "my-project"` to write tools.
**After:** the project is auto-detected from the server's working directory (cwd). Any `project` argument sent by the LLM is silently discarded.

**Migration:**

- Remove `project` from write tool calls in your agent's memory protocol.
- Use `mem_current_project` (new tool) to inspect which project Engram will use before writing.
- If the cwd is ambiguous (multiple git repos), Engram returns a structured error with `available_projects`. Navigate to one of the repos before writing.
- Read tools (`mem_search`, `mem_context`, `mem_timeline`, `mem_get_observation`, `mem_stats`) still accept an optional `project` override — validated against the store.

### New tool: `mem_current_project`

Returns detection result including `project`, `project_source`, `project_path`, `cwd`, `available_projects`, and `warning`. Never errors — returns success even when the cwd is ambiguous. Recommended as the first call when starting a session to confirm which project will receive writes.

- **feat(project):** add project name auto-detection via git remote and normalization (lowercase + trim + collapse) on all read/write paths
- **feat(cli):** add `engram projects list|consolidate|prune` commands for project hygiene
- **feat(mcp):** add `mem_merge_projects` tool for agent-driven project consolidation
- **feat(mcp):** auto-detect project at MCP startup via `--project` flag, `ENGRAM_PROJECT` env, or git remote
- **feat(mcp):** similar-project warnings when saving to a new project that resembles an existing one
- **fix(sync):** use git remote detection instead of `filepath.Base(cwd)` for project name
