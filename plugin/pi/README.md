**Give every Pi session the same brain — local by default, cloud when you want it, and searchable across agents.**

Pi is great at doing the work in front of it. The problem is everything around the work: what the agent learned yesterday, which architecture decision was accepted, why a bug was fixed a certain way, what the user prefers, and what should survive when the context window compacts.

Engram is persistent memory for AI coding agents. `gentle-engram` connects Pi to that memory so your agent can save the useful parts of a session and retrieve them later — without stuffing raw tool output back into the prompt.

## At a glance

| You want                    | Engram gives Pi                                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Fewer repeated explanations | Selective search of Memory from previous sessions       |
| Lower context waste         | One terminal disposition instead of routine activity logs |
| Continuity after compaction | The same root-turn checkpoint identity and recovery cue   |
| One memory across tools     | Shared MCP-backed memory for Pi and other agents           |
| Team/project memory         | Optional Engram Cloud replication and dashboard            |

## The promise

Install it once. Keep coding. Pi remembers.

- **One brain for many agents** — Pi, Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Codex, VS Code/Copilot, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, and any MCP-compatible agent can read/write the same Engram memory.
- **Local-first memory** — a single Go binary writes to SQLite + FTS5 on your machine. No Node service, Python stack, or hosted account required for the core path.
- **Cloud when the team needs it** — Engram Cloud adds opt-in, project-scoped replication, shared access, and a browser dashboard while keeping local SQLite authoritative.
- **Token-efficient by design** — Engram stores curated summaries, decisions, and session handoffs instead of a noisy firehose of raw tool calls. Optional prompt capture is a separate local Diagnostic facility, disabled by default and excluded from Recall.
- **Compaction survival** — Pi's host lifecycle capture can retain a recovery summary, while the agent continues the same root turn and commits its terminal disposition only after work settles.
- **Simple Pi setup** — install the Pi package, install the MCP adapter, run `pi-engram init`, restart Pi.
- **Built in public** — Engram is developed as an open-source, hands-on agentic-coding tool rather than a toy demo.
- **Real open-source project** — Engram ships docs, releases, beta programs, contributor guidelines, issue templates, CI, and a growing contributor/community workflow around the main repository.

## Built with the community

Engram is not an abandoned side script or a black-box SaaS. It is built in public for developers who are already using coding agents seriously.

- **YouTube channel**: tutorials, demos, and product thinking around AI coding workflows — <https://www.youtube.com/c/GentlemanProgramming>
- **Engram + SDD + Skills demo**: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoS_LP-PCG8>
- **Engram Cloud demo**: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPZkbGgJNUQ>
- **GitHub community**: issues, discussions, beta feedback, contributors, and transparent roadmap work — <https://github.com/yersonargotev/engram>

The goal is simple: make agentic development feel like a real engineering system — memory, specs, skills, cloud sync, review discipline, and community learning all connected.

## Why this is different from “more context”

Context windows are temporary. Engram is memory.

| More context                        | Engram memory                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Helps during the current run        | Helps across sessions, agents, machines, and compactions |
| Often includes raw logs/tool output | Stores curated, searchable knowledge                     |
| Gets summarized away                | Persists in SQLite + FTS5                                |
| Usually tied to one agent           | Works through MCP across agent clients                   |

Engram does not try to make the model read everything. Its default protocol selectively searches when prior Memory can change the work, fetches full details only for selected results, and makes one Terminal Memory commit after each settled root user turn.

## See the memory

  <img width="380" alt="Engram search results" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yersonargotev/engram/main/assets/tui-search.png" />
</p>

Engram includes a terminal UI for browsing sessions, observations, projects,
timelines, and Memory search results. Diagnostic prompt content and the frozen
Legacy prompt archive are not ordinary browsing surfaces. Engram Cloud adds
browser visibility for shared project Memory.

## Quick start

```bash
pi install npm:gentle-engram@0.1.8
pi install npm:pi-mcp-adapter
pi-engram init
```

Restart Pi after installation, then ask Pi what it remembers about the current project. The default profile uses `mem_search` and `mem_get_observation` for selective Recall; `mem_context` is available only in the explicit specialized profile.

## What gets installed

`gentle-engram` connects Pi to Engram through two complementary paths:

| Path         | Purpose                                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pi extension | Reports session events, injects the Terminal Memory policy, exposes the five default Pi-native Memory tools, and offers prompts only to the explicit default-off local Diagnostic consent gate. |
| MCP tools    | Keeps Engram's MCP surface available through `pi-mcp-adapter` for clients and flows that use MCP directly.                             |

```text
Pi events/tools -> gentle-engram extension -> ENGRAM_URL / engram serve -> SQLite
Pi MCP tools   -> pi-mcp-adapter -> ENGRAM_BIN / engram mcp -> SQLite
```

The default Pi-native profile exposes exactly `mem_current_project`, `mem_search`, `mem_get_observation`, `mem_checkpoint`, and `mem_checkpoint_status`. It commits one terminal disposition—`saved`, `needs_review`, or `skipped(no_durable_knowledge)`—for each settled root user turn. Current user intent, maintained source, and runtime evidence override Memory.

Pi routes `mem_search` through Core's authority-aware `/recall` endpoint. The
initial narrow project request returns at most five candidate summaries and
4 KiB, with one possible reformulation; limits 6-10 and broad scope are
deliberate. Weak identity, empty results, or provider failure return no
candidates and a visible warning without blocking the task.

Independent save, optional Session summary, consent-gated Diagnostic capture
requests, passive capture, review, diagnostics, and administration remain
callable through the explicit specialized profile: set
`ENGRAM_PI_TOOL_PROFILE=all`. Diagnostic capture is disabled by default and
never feeds Recall, context, or Memory statistics. Use that profile only for
curation, lifecycle, capture, or operational workflows; those operations are
not part of the default agent contract. MCP tools remain a separate stdio path
and `engram mcp --tools=agent` uses the same five-tool default.

## Compact memory tool rendering

`gentle-engram` owns the Pi chrome for Engram memory tools. Default tools and explicitly selected specialized tools share the same compact rendering:

```text
🧠 search “auth model” …
↳ ✓ 4 results
```

For lifecycle review, `mem_review` keeps the collapsed output explicit without exposing raw tool payloads:

```text
🧠 review list “engram” limit 10 …
↳ ✓ 3 need review

🧠 review mark_reviewed #42 …
↳ ✓ reviewed #42
```

`action=list` shows memories whose local `review_after` timestamp is due. `action=mark_reviewed` asks Engram core to reset that observation's local review clock according to its memory type. That review reset is local-only today: it updates the local lifecycle metadata but is not treated as a cloud/git sync mutation until the sync wire format carries lifecycle review fields.

Normal memory activity also updates the status bar with short progress/result text such as `🧠 engram · search…` and `🧠 engram · ✓ 4 results`. The extension does not use notifications for normal memory operations.

When a tool call fails because Engram cannot determine which project to use, the status bar shows an actionable label instead of the generic `error`:

| Status bar label           | Meaning                                                                                               |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `🧠 repos · ambiguous project` | Pi was started from a directory that contains multiple git repos. Run Pi from inside a single repo, or add `.engram/config.json` with `project_name` to the parent directory. |
| `🧠 repos · error`         | A different tool or network error occurred. Expand the tool output in Pi for the full error message.  |

Full tool details remain available by expanding the tool output in Pi. If `gentle-engram` or the Engram server is not installed/running, the compact tool reports an error instead of implying memory is available.

## What Pi can remember

- Architecture decisions and tradeoffs
- Bug fixes, root causes, and gotchas
- User preferences and project conventions
- Session goals, next steps, and handoff summaries
- Optional local Diagnostic prompt capture after explicit project/content-type consent; it remains outside Memory and Recall
- Cross-machine/team memory once a project is enrolled in Engram Cloud

## Private blocks

`gentle-engram` redacts explicit private blocks before offering prompts to the
default-off local Diagnostic consent gate or sending passive observations and
compaction summaries to Engram:

```text
<private>
this should not be persisted verbatim
</private>
```

The persisted payload keeps the surrounding text but replaces the private block with `[REDACTED]`. Redaction is applied recursively to string values in outgoing JSON payloads and to query values in Engram HTTP requests.

This is a lightweight convenience convention, not a full secret-scanning system. Do not rely on it to detect credentials automatically.

## Compaction recovery

When Pi emits a compaction lifecycle event, `gentle-engram` best-effort extracts a compacted summary as lifecycle capture and saves it as a `session_summary` observation with topic key `session/compaction-recovery`. This is host lifecycle behavior, not the agent's Terminal Memory operation.

Unsupported event shapes fail gracefully. The extension re-injects the Terminal Memory cue so the agent continues the same root user turn and finalizes it only after the remaining work settles; compaction does not mandate a Session summary or create a new checkpoint identity.

## Local, sync, or cloud

Engram can grow with your workflow:

| Mode         | Use it when                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Local SQLite | You want fast private memory on one machine.                                                |
| Git sync     | You want portable compressed memory chunks without a hosted service.                        |
| Engram Cloud | You want shared project memory, browser visibility, and replication across machines/agents. |

Cloud is opt-in and project-scoped. Local SQLite remains the source of truth; cloud replicates and makes memory visible when you explicitly enroll a project.

## Requirements

- Pi coding agent with npm package support.
- Engram installed as `engram` on `PATH`, or `ENGRAM_BIN` pointing at the binary.
- `pi-mcp-adapter` only if you want the optional MCP gateway for compatibility/debugging; Pi-native `mem_*` tools come from `gentle-engram`.

If you only want HTTP session capture against an already running Engram server, set `ENGRAM_URL` and the extension will not auto-start a local `engram serve` process.

## Configuration

### Existing Engram server

Use an already running Engram HTTP server:

```bash
ENGRAM_URL=http://127.0.0.1:7437 pi
```

When `ENGRAM_URL` is set, the extension treats the server as externally managed and does not auto-start `engram serve`.

### Custom Engram binary

Use a custom Engram binary for MCP tools and local auto-start:

```bash
ENGRAM_BIN=/path/to/engram pi
```

If the binary is missing, Pi keeps running and memory degrades instead of crashing with `spawn engram ENOENT`.

## Install command details

`pi-engram init` writes Pi-owned config in the Pi agent directory:

- `settings.json`: ensures `npm:pi-mcp-adapter` and `npm:gentle-engram@0.1.8` are declared.
- `mcp.json`: adds an `engram` MCP server that launches `engram mcp --tools=agent` through a safe Node wrapper with `directTools: false`, so MCP remains available through the gateway without duplicating Pi-native `mem_*` tools.

`engram setup pi` also auto-pins `npmCommand` in Pi's `settings.json` when [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/) is detected in `PATH`. It sets `npmCommand` to `["mise", "exec", "node@<version>", "--", "npm"]` so Pi always uses the mise-managed Node version. Existing `npmCommand` values are never overwritten; if mise is not found, this step is a no-op.

Existing `mcpServers.engram` entries are preserved unless you pass `--force`:

```bash
pi-engram init --force
```

The command respects `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`; otherwise it writes to `~/.pi/agent`.

## Project detection

Pi lifecycle events, default-off Diagnostic capture requests, and Pi-native
tools consume one configured Engram HTTP provider.
Terminal commits use `POST /checkpoints` and `GET /checkpoints/status`; Recall and
write authority consume Engram core's `/project/current` classification from that
same provider. `config` and `git_remote` are strong automatic identities;
`git_root`, `git_child`, and `dir_basename` remain available for reads but cannot
create sessions, Diagnostic captures, or observations implicitly. A weak write reports
`weak_project_identity` and asks for an explicit project. If the route is missing
on an older running server, the adapter accepts only the nearest local
`.engram/config.json` as a strong compatibility fallback and returns a
version-mismatch warning. For critical repos or monorepos, prefer an explicit
`.engram/config.json`:

```json
{
  "project_name": "my-project"
}
```

## Next steps

- Run `engram tui` to inspect stored memories.
- Use `mem_current_project` to confirm `project_strength` and write authority, then let the canonical skill select `saved`, `needs_review`, or `skipped(no_durable_knowledge)` for the settled root turn.
